# Human-Machines
An open repository for 3D modeling prosthesis. 

Human Machines is the 3D Printed Prosthetics Division of PantherHackers at Georgia State University. We strive to create low cost 3D printed prosthetic solutions for people in need.

## Fall 2019 Goals
- Refine 3D Scan to 3D Printed Prosthetic Pipeline
- Develop electonic prosthetics to aid with motion
- Cooperate with EXLAB on 3D scanning technology
- Plan PantherHack HealthHacks Hackathon (Spring 2020)

## GSURC Spring 2019
We presented our research at GSURC, outlining a pipeline for developing prosthetics using 3D scanning and design software.
