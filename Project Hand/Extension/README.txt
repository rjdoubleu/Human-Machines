# Summary

This is an extension for the Exo Gauntet which can be found over here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1982745

I wanted a bigger gauntlet but not all the way up to my shoulder so i made an extension that will fit the earlier mentioned design perfectly!

I printed the gauntlet itself (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1982745) at 1.10% scale since i have big hands. The extension and the shell are made to fit a 1.10% gauntlet. If you plan on printing the gauntlet at 100% scale my files to 0.91 so that they are the same size again!

*you dont need to print the "Cuff_no_suit" file since this will replace that!

Hope you enjoy it!

- Dont mind the colours i plan on finishing it with a post-apocalyptic weathered look.
- The black part is just a regular black rubber glove wich can be bought at any hardware store.

# Print Settings

Printer: Cetus3D
Rafts: Yes
Supports: Yes
Resolution: 0,2
Infill: 0-20%

Notes: 
I printed the white part (extension) at 0,2 resolution with 20% infill
I printed the red part (sleeve) at 0,2 resolution with 0% infill (shell), since they are both exactly 100mm in diameter the 0% infill gives an extra bit of flexibility to fit them together without glue!

Both parts and the gauntlet were printed in PLA.
