# Summary

These gauntlets are an addition to my Exo-suit project that replace the original stirrup style hands. I've included a separate Cuff so they can be worn alone without rest of the suit. 

Everything except the knuckle hardware can be printed at 20% infill with 0.6mm sides.
The Knuckle hardware needs to be printed at 100% infill.
Print at 20mm/sec or slower, max 0.2mm layer height and supports "everywhere".
I've included only one copy of each file. The fingers are the same from left to right hand. The thumb is the same but assembled opposite.

The end pieces of the fingers can break if bent too far when assembled.

Make sure the parts are clean of all supports, holes are cleaned out and the posts are round. Test fit and verify all parts before melting or gluing the retainers down.
Please follow the pictures for assembly instructions.
